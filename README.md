# ExerciseManager
Log and manage and randomly generate exercise and treadmill intervals.

There are plenty of Applications that allow the user the view exercises and log workouts.  The reason that I'm developing this application is
to use new technologies, experiment with UI designs, and add functionality that I desire in an fitness apps like this.

Purpose of the Application:

Allow user to log exercise details, set details
	1 set involves number of reps, weight, and name.

Allow the user to keep track of progression.
	Progression is measured by setting feedback on the exercise by the values of EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD
		If weight was easy, move up to next weight
		If weight was hard, move down a weight
		If weight was just right (MEDIUM), stay on that weight, option to increase number of reps
